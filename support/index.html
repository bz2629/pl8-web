  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>
    PL8 helps you cook smarter by organizing your pantry, fridge, and grocery list in one place. 
    You can snap a photo of your fridge, scan items, or add them manually. PL8 then generates 
    recipes that fit your serving size, dietary preferences, and ingredient needs. You can 
    also browse unique recipes or view recommendations personalized just for you.
  </p>

  <h2>Common Questions</h2>
  <h3>How do I add items to my inventory?</h3>
  <p>
    You can take a photo of your pantry or fridge, scan barcodes, or enter items manually. 
    PL8 will track everything in your inventory so it’s ready when you plan meals.
  </p>

  <h3>Can PL8 suggest recipes if I don’t add ingredients?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. You can browse recipes and discover new ideas even without uploading your current 
    ingredients. Recommendations will still reflect your dietary and serving preferences.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I manage dietary preferences?</h3>
  <p>
    During account setup, you can select serving sizes, diets, and ingredient restrictions. 
    You can update these anytime in your account settings.
  </p>

  <h3>How will PL8 connect to grocery shopping?</h3>
  <p>
    In upcoming versions, you’ll be able to add missing items directly to your grocery cart 
    and check out seamlessly with supported retailers.
  </p>

  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If the app is not responding, try restarting PL8 or your device.</li>
    <li>Ensure you have the latest version of the app installed from the App Store.</li>
    <li>Check your internet connection, as PL8 requires access to sync and fetch recipes.</li>
  </ul>
